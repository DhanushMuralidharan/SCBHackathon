#Introduction to Cheque OCR

Cheque OCR (Optical Character Recognition) is a technology that automates the process of extracting information from paper cheques, including the amount, payee, date, and signature. Traditionally, banks and financial institutions manually process cheques, which can be time-consuming and error-prone. Cheque OCR streamlines this process by using image processing techniques and machine learning algorithms to accurately read and interpret cheque images.
